    <p class="lead">This plugin provides easier-than-ever embedding of content from various sites and services. Works with both CMS Pages and <a href="https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-pages">Static Pages</a>.</p>
    <p>This plugin is optimized to work with the <a href="https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-pages">Static Pages</a> plugin. Every component this plugin provides will also be registered as a snippet. This makes it super easy to embed things on a static page with the rich editor. This makes it really easy for even end-users or clients to do embedding - without a line of code!</p>
