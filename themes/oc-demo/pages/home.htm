    <p class="lead">This plugin provides easier-than-ever embedding of content from various sites and services. Works with both CMS Pages and <a href="https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-pages">Static Pages</a>.</p>
    <p>This plugin is optimized to work with the <a href="https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-pages">Static Pages</a> plugin. Every component this plugin provides will also be registered as a snippet. This makes it super easy to embed things on a static page with the rich editor. This makes it really easy for even end-users or clients to do embedding - without a line of code!</p>

    </h2>
    <p class="lead">This plugin helps you set up an interactive demo of your new plugin in 1-2-3.</p>
    <p>A live demo makes it really easy for users to evaluate the quality of a plugin without having to install and configure it first. This is great for free plugins, as it may increase the number of downloads and maybe even donations. But a live demo shines even brighter when it comes to paid plugins, where installing and testing it beforehand isn't even an option.</p>
    <p>This site is powered by the DemoManager plugin.</p>
